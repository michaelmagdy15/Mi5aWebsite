== Description ==
WpStream is designed for effortless Live Streaming, Video-On-Demand and Pay-Per-View. It is your live-streaming solution, specially designed for WordPress to provide an affordable and seamless experience.

Choose from an array of monthly streaming plans that have been predefined and selectively calculated to suit each business and entrepreneur. 

You may stream live directly from the browser or use specialized RTMP broadcast software like OBS, Wirecast, Larix, etc. Moreover, you are not limited to desktop Apps, you can even use your smartphone. Complete instructions and video tutorials are available on our <a href="https://wpstream.net/blog/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIjItiJc4Z7aJApj3W6ArJA">YouTube channel</a>.

== What’s New? ==
We are happy to announce that we have recently launched our Consultancy Program. In this program, we assign a consultant to a customer based on their needs. This was done with the aim of offering a highly personalized experience before, during, and after live-streams. These consultants act as an extension of our own support team but resolve issues that are outside our support team's reach.

Consultants aid with navigating WordPress, resolve plugin conflicts and misconfigurations, explain and help implement beta and experimental features, and provide all this in the language of your choice.
