== What’s New? ==
Due to popular demand, you can now enable regular users to broadcast via the Front-End!
Starting with WpStream 3.7.1, admins can allow regular users to broadcast through the Front-End (not in wp-admin area), meaning that users who are not administrators can now independently broadcast videos. There is a new Shortcode, a Visual Bakery block, and an Elementor widget. For more information, please check out its <a href="https://wpstream.net/how-to-enable-regular-users-to-broadcast-via-the-front-end/">documentation</a>.
